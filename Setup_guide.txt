HOW TO ADD REFERENCE OF DIFFERENT LIBRARIES?
=> Put styles.css file inside css folder to apply our custom styles. link this file in index.html head tag.

=> Put app.js file inside  js folder to apply our custom js code. give its reference before the body tag inside index.html.
We are using jquery inside app.js file. So first give reference of jquery before the reference of app.js. as we include 
dependencies first before using that dependency.

=> Similarly give cdn reference of bootstrap.css and bootstrap.js.

=> Except cdn you can store the libraries inside the lib directory. Like we did in case of bootstrap.min.css.
=> then inside link tag give the reference of that file. It is working fine.


Following command to run on local server. 
$ node server
